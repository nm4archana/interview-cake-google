/*
 I figured out how to get rich: online poker.
I suspect the online poker game I'm playing shuffles cards by doing a single " riffle â†´ ."

To prove this, let's write a function to tell us if a full deck of cards shuffledDeck is a single riffle of two other halves half1 and half2.

We'll represent a stack of cards as an array of integers in the range 
1..52 (since there are 52 distinct cards in a deck).

Why do I care? A single riffle is not a completely random shuffle. If I'm right, 
I can make more informed bets and get rich and finally prove to my ex that I am not a 
"loser with an unhealthy cake obsession" (even though it's too late now because she 
let me go and she's never getting me back).
